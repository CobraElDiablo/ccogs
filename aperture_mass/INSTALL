This file will walk you through the compilation and installation process. The 
accompanying README file can show you how to run the code and verify that you've
installed it properly.

# Requirements 
################################################################################

These directions assume you are installing this in a Linux environment.

-------------------------------
# Requrements for GPU code.
-------------------------------
gcc: C/C++ compiler. Tested with 4.1.

make: Standard compilation utility.

CUDA: Tested with version 4.1. It is possible that this code will work with 
older versions. 


----------------------------------------------
# Requrements for testing and plotting code.
----------------------------------------------


python: the test scripts have been written in python. 
pyfits: the utility to create a fits file from the aperture mass output file uses pyfits.

# Compiling and installing
################################################################################

From this directory, descend into the src direction and type ``make". That's it!
You will need to edit the Makefile to point to your own installation of CUDA and the SDK. 

    cd src
    make



----------------------------------------------
# Tweaking the build and installation.
----------------------------------------------

Let's take a closer look at the Makefile and what you may want to change either
because of personal preference, or by necessity. 

* Installation location.

    INSTALL_DIR       := ./
   
The test scripts will assume that the executables are located here. However,
depending on your setup and how many people will be using this code, you may
want to change this to a location common to users "PATH"s like "/usr/local/bin".

In any event, for general usage, you will want the installation directory to be
in the users "PATH" variable.

* Libraries.

    CUDA_SDK = /path/to/my/cuda/sdk/installation
    CUDA_INSTALL_PATH := /opt/cuda
    
You may have to edit thse paths to point to where your CUDA libraries and SDK
are installed. Note that these paths appear in the definitions of the include
files and library paths. There is a chance you may have to edit these as well.

INCLUDES          += -I. -I$(CUDA_INSTALL_PATH)/include  -I$(CUDA_SDK)/C/common/inc 
LIBS              := -L$(CUDA_INSTALL_PATH)/lib64  -L$(CUDA_SDK)/C/common/lib/ -L$(CUDA_SDK)/C/lib/ 


We have found many CUDA installations to be somewhat different and rather than 
trying to provide a fix for every set-up, we have merely tried to provide some 
guidance. If you are still having problems, please consult us or the NVIDIA 
CUDA documentation.
