## CUDA guides
########################

In developing this code, the authors have made extensive reference of the CUDA programming guide and example code made available by NVIDIA Corporation. 
In particular, we use parts of the NVIDIA device_query code to obtain information about the GPU card. 

We have also used the Dr Dobbs supercomputing blog as a useful resource, and the error checking function we include in this code is adapted from code given on that site.

The authors would also like to thank Risa Wechsler and Jan Kratochvil for allowing use of their simulated data as test data.
